    "Approach\n",
    "Initialize two empty dictionaries count1 and count2 to count the occurrences of each number in nums1 and nums2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through each number in nums1 and increment its count in count1. The get() method is used to return the current count of the number if it is already in the dictionary, or 0 if it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through each number in nums2 and increment its count in count2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialize an empty list arr to hold the intersection of the two arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through each number in count1.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number is also in count2, then the minimum of the counts of the number in count1 and count2 is taken and the number is appended to arr that many times using the extend() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return arr containing the intersection of the two arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity: The time complexity of this code is O(m + n), \n",
    "where m and n are the lengths of the two arrays nums1 and nums2, respectively. This is because the two for loops that count the occurrences of each number in the two arrays have a time complexity of O(m + n) in total, and the third loop that finds the intersection has a time complexity of O(min(m, n)) because it only iterates over the smaller dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity: The space complexity of this code is O(min(m, n)), \n",
    "because it uses two dictionaries count1 and count2 to count the occurrences of each number in the two arrays. The space complexity of the new list arr that holds the intersection of the two arrays is also O(min(m, n)), because it can hold at most min(m, n) elements.\n",
